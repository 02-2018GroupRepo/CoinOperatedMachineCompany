The coin company will run in the terminal.

A user will be prompted with a series of questions, and will be able to perform different actions.

An operator will have different permissions than a customer, and they will need to enter a passcode.

A customer will be able to purchase items at any location, and receive change from the machines.

There will be limited types of products so that I can focus more on the Java.

Proposed Products:

Drinks: CocaCola, Sprite, Beer, Powerade, RootBeer
Snacks: Chips, CandyBar, Gum, HoneyBuns, Cheetos, Mints

I have yet to decide if it is best to store products and coins in data structures, 
    or if it is more logical to just make global variables for coins on the Machine class, and product types on each machine type.
