The plan is to make the coin company run in the terminal.

A user will be prompted with a series of questions, and will be able to perform different actions.

An operator will have different permissions than a customer, and they will need to enter a passcode.

A customer will be able to purchase items at any location, and receive change from the machines.

There will be limited types of products so that I can focus more on the Java.

Proposed Products:

Drinks: CocaCola, Sprite, Beer, Powerade, RootBeer
Snacks: Chips, CandyBar, Gum, HoneyBuns, Cheetos, Mints
